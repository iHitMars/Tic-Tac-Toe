## Introduction

This repository contains a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python for the CAP 4630 course at Florida Atlantic University. The game features an AI opponent that uses the MINMAX algorithm to make its moves. The project aims to demonstrate the fundamentals of game logic, user interface design, and adversarial search techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-minmax.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe-minmax
   ```
3. Run the Python script to start the game.
   ```
   python a1_FAUusername.py
   ```

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python file (`a1_FAUusername.py`) that contains all the necessary functions and logic to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent.

### Functions

- `display_board(board)`: Displays the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- `check_winner(board)`: Checks for a winner.
- `check_tie(board)`: Checks for a tie.
- `minmax(board, depth, maximizing)`: Implements the MINMAX algorithm for AI decision-making.
- `player_move(board)`: Handles the player's move.
- `computer_move(board)`: Handles the computer's move.

---

## Usage

1. Run the script.
   ```
   python a1_FAUusername.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to make your move.
3. After each game, you can choose to play again or exit.
